It exposes information about socketâ€™s underlying TCP session, TLS and HTTP (more than 60 metrics). you can run it through command line or as a service. the request is highly customizable and you can integrate it with your application through gRPC. it runs in a Kubernetes cluster as cloud native application and by adding annotations on pods allow a fine control of the probing process.
